Mirasys Spotter Web & Mobile

Developed for remote users who need easy access to their offsite video surveillance installation. Mirasys Spotter Web & Mobile provides an easy-to-use interface with an intuitive resource experience through any browser, without the need for additional software.

Remote control and management. Access from your desktop or mobile device.

New HTML5 based client. Own UI for the Spotter Mobile.

No installation is required. The same application can be used with any browser.

Support for multi-channel device licensing

Now, when a customer uses any device with more than 1 channel, whether an encoder or a multi-sensor camera, only 1 VMS camera license for every 4 channels or for each device is used.
Users can remove each channel independently.
If the device has 16 channels Mirasys VMS would utilize 4 x VMS camera licenses.
The dual-lens camera would consume one VMS camera license

Motion ​​pre-and post-recording

Motion ​​pre-and post-recording can now be used to have recorded material before and after the motion.

No more need to create alarms to achieve pre-and post-recording!

What's improved
Replacement of individual channels from multi-channel device

The user can replace any channel from a multi-channel device and replace it with an IP camera. This change saves the installer time during the upgrade process and offers more flexibility for the hardware change.

In previous versions, the user can only replace the camera channel from the multi-channel device from the end.

Free text search for Storage Locker and Incident Reporting plugins

From now on, the user can do a free text search in Storage Locker and Incident Reporting.

Track active device on device tree

Users can see from the profile tree which camera they are using when selecting a camera from the map or the camera grid to keep track of where the camera is located.

Master server performance

The Mirasys Master server performance was improved to work better in large installations. Also, failover performance was increased.

Fixes
VCA Core 1.5

We fixed the issue with VCA and the virtual environment. Now VCA also works with the virtual environment.
