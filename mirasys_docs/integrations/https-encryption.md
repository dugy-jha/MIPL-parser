HTTPS encryption

HTTPS consists of communication over HTTP within a connection encrypted by
Transport Layer Security (TLS).
Network encryption protects the communication between the client, VMS, and the
network device. It prevents information being extracted by network traffic sniffing,
and it prevents data being altered during transfer.
