Create a new user account for the use of the Service Desk portal

Reset a forgotten Service Desk password

View and change profile information

View submitted support requests

Submit a new support request

Keep a track of the status of a support request

Update a request with a new information

Log out of the system

Each support request will get its own easily trackable support ticket identifier.
