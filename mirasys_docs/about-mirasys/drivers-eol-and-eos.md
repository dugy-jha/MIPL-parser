Drivers EOL and EOS

Please see a List of our current Drivers here.

Please see Mirasys End of Life (EOL) and End of Support (EOS) Policy here.

📣
We are moving EOL Drivers to Extranet

In V9.9.0, we are making an important change regarding how End of Life (EOL) drivers are distributed: Only drivers that have reached EOL will be moved to our Extranet and removed from the standard installation package. This change helps us streamline the installation process while still making EOL drivers available for our customers who need them.

Where to Find the EOL Drivers

If you are using any EOL drivers, they are now available for download on our Extranet. You can access and install only the specific drivers your system requires. Please note that these drivers will not be included in the default installation package moving forward.

Installing an external Driver package

Please see our documentation on how to instal an external Driver package here.

Why Are We Making This Change?

By removing EOL drivers from the installation package, we reduce its size and focus the installation on current, fully supported drivers.

We fully prioritize the development and support of current drivers.

You still have access to EOL drivers when needed, and you can choose only those relevant to your system.

Action Required: Are You Using EOL Drivers?

If you are using any of the drivers that have reached EOL, please contact our support team.

It is important for us to understand if these drivers are still in use before they reach End of Support (EOS).

Your feedback will help determine whether these drivers need to be maintained longer or if they can be phased out entirely.

Thank you.
