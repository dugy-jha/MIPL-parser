Notes on Upgrading to V9

V7 and V8 can be upgraded to V9. For earlier versions, please contact our Sales and Support.

New version types Base, Pro, Enterprise and Enterprise Plus will help to reach different market segments.

Version 9 will also contain a new user interface for the VCA configuration inside the System Manager.

Should there be a problem with image scaling in Spotter V9 and part of the image is not shown on the screen, go to Settings > Video > Video data format and enable RGB by clicking the radio button.

Most VCA settings from V7 or V8 to V9 will be automatically converted but must be reviewed.
