Mirasys EOL and EOS Policy

Our End of Life (EOL) and End of Support (EOS) policies are designed to ensure that we continue delivering reliable and secure solutions while focusing resources on maintaining and enhancing our most current products and services. These terms are crucial for both our development process and our customers, allowing for a smooth transition from older versions to newer, more secure, and feature-rich software.

What is End of Life (EOL)?

End of Life (EOL) refers to the stage in our product's lifecycle where we cease offering new feature updates or enhancements.

Products in the EOL stage will no longer receive new features or improvements, but they are still be eligible for critical security updates and essential maintenance as they approach the EOS phase.

What is End of Support (EOS)?

End of Support (EOS) is the final phase of a product's lifecycle. Once a product reaches EOS, we will no longer provide any maintenance, technical support, or security updates.

Customers using a product that has reached EOS are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version to continue receiving full support.

Why Does Mirasy Have EOL and EOS Policies?

Our End of Life (EOL) and End of Support (EOS) policies are designed with your needs in mind, ensuring that you continue to benefit from the most advanced and secure solutions we can offer.

As technology progresses, we concentrate our efforts on enhancing and supporting our latest products. This ensures that you always have access to the most up-to-date features, improved performance, and the highest levels of security.

Older products can become more vulnerable over time. By retiring outdated versions, we can focus on keeping the products you rely on safe and compliant with the latest security standards, reducing your risk and helping protect your system.

Technology moves quickly, and older products may limit your ability to take advantage of new innovations. By setting clear EOL and EOS dates, we help you transition smoothly to newer versions, ensuring you benefit from improved functionality, better performance, and ongoing support.
