Important notes

Mirasys VMS V9 is only available as a 64-bit version.

A V9 Master Server (Management Server) can handle 64-bit V8 and V9 servers.

The "Full" Installer will automatically install the SQL Server Express 2019 or upgrade an earlier SQL installation to 2019 on 64-bit systems.

The old "Spotter Mobile" does not support Apple iOS 11 or later versions on Apple iPhone or iPad devices.

Use the newer "Spotter Seven" instead (requires Mirasys VMS V7 or later).
