Setup multiple Displays

It is preferable to have the resolution exact in all monitors OR have the largest resolution in monitor 1.

Do the following for setup:

  Align the image's top Edges.

  Preferably, make monitor 1 the primary display.

  Make the monitors either in a horizontal row or otherwise in Logical order.

 Make the mouse move nicely on the monitors.

Some older TV models won't show the full PC image automatically.
Adjust this and readjust the monitor order afterward.
