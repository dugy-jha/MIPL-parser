VMS Servers

The VMS servers record video and audio from multiple cameras and audio channels and write the data to a storage device. A server is a computer with storage, the Windows operating system, and the installed Mirasys VMS software with required drivers. 

You can access a VMS Server locally or over a network using the System Manager and Spotter programs and monitor server functionality through the Spotter Diagnostics plugin.

Several devices can be connected to a VMS Server:

PTZ (dome) cameras and keyboards

External devices, such as sensors, to the digital inputs

External devices, such as doors, lights, and gates, connected to digital outputs 

Special integrated devices like radar, IoT device or 3rd party system

Storage or backup unit (NAS, SAN, or RAID, for example)
