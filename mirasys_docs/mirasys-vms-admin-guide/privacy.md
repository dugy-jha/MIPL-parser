Privacy

Under the Privacy menu, you can control the privacy zones of the camera and the facial- and movement blurring functionality.

To be noted: the content of the privacy functionalities is available (for the user) only if they are defined for the camera.
(I.e. if the camera does not have, e.g. the facial blurring defined, this camera shall not have the faces blurred – even if the user group of the end-user would have permission level set to view only unblurred materials.
This also applies when exporting the materials.
