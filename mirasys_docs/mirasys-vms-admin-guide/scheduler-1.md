Scheduler

The Scheduler defines which motion mask is used for each camera at what time. You can select active days for a motion mask, or even more granular, active hours. By default, video is recorded when the system detects motion in the default mask. The default mask is active 24/7 by default.

For each hour of the week, you can set different options, like using different motion detection masks during the day and the night. The Scheduler has the following options:

Off
Video is not recorded. However, possible alarms are recorded. Alarms are configured in Alarm Settings.

Continuous
The camera records all images. This option uses a lot of disk space.

Default mask
The camera records video using the default motion detection mask and default motion detection parameters.

Custom mask
The camera records video using a custom mask. Each camera can have as many as four custom masks.
