Search in VMS Server settings
Search in the VMS Server settings tab

In the VMS Server settings tab, you can search for a specific device. For example, if you have several recorders and are looking for a specific camera, like "Roundabout camera", and you need to narrow down in what recorder it is, you can search in the recorder tab and it will then only display the VMS server, and underneath only the settings where you can find the Garage camera.

Narrow down the search from the VMS Server settings tab

If you open, for example, camera settings under the Search in VMS Server settings tab, the Roundabout camera from the example above is already filtered out. The search can be reset in the individual settings tabs.

Search in individual settings

Within individual settings, you can search for a device. There is a search bar in the following settings:

Camera settings

Audio settings

Hardware settings

Digital I/O settings

Storage settings
