Licenses

The server needs a valid license for full functionality.
Depending on the installation, you may need to upgrade the license information when adding new functionality or cameras to the system.

To get a license key, please contact your supplier and follow the license upgrade procedure as detailed by the supplier.

If you have any problems in upgrading the license, please contact orders@mirasys.com.

You can also add more camera channels and features such as VCA capabilities to a server by getting a new license key.
