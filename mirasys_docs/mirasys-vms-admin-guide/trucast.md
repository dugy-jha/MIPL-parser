TruCast

TruCast is the direct camera video streaming feature in Mirasys VMS.

With TruCast, the video stream comes directly from the camera to the viewing client, the Spotter for Windows application.

In a standard streaming scenario, the stream to the client comes from the VMS Server.

 Stream from the server to the client
 Stream from the camera directly to the client

It is possible to get the direct stream from the camera to the client when the VMS Server connection is OK. This can be useful if users want to optimize network utilization.
