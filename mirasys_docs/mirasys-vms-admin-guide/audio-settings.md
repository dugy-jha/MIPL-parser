Audio Settings

The system supports three basic types of audio components:

One-way analogue and IP audio channels: These include mainly camera-based and separate microphones.

Two-way IP audio channels: Two-way IP audio channels require an IP camera with an audio input and output channel.

Two-way IP audio channels are used for communication between the camera site and a Spotter client.

Only one Spotter client can be used for communication at any time, but other clients in the system can listen to the channel and take over the communication if required.

All communication that passes through a two-way IP audio channel is recorded in the system.

A single audio communication channel: An older communication model. Each system contains one communication channel.

The drawback in using the audio communication channel is that the signal bypasses the server, meaning that the communication is not recorded in the system.
