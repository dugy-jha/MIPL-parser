Installing Client Drivers

TruCast (direct streaming from camera to Spotter client) requires a different type of camera driver.

These are called (Managed) TruCast Client drivers.

The client camera drivers are installed similarly as spotter plugins and metadata drivers, using the Install client driver option in the system manager.
