Watchdog

The system has a software watchdog (system monitoring service) that monitors the system and performs specific actions if problems occur.

In the Watchdog tool, you can select the events for which the notification list is notified through e-mail and access watchdog logs, which contain the events that have occurred and the actions that have taken place.
