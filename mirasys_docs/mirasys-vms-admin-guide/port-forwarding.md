Port Forwarding

The basic idea with port forwarding is that it can access one or more VMS Servers or Master Servers behind a router that does Network Address Translation (NAT).

Typically, this situation happens when the client is outside the network and needs to access servers inside a company network.When installing a VMS Server, the installer offers the option to turn on the automatic port forwarding. The default state is off
If the port forwarding is not activated when the system is installed, it can be activated from the second tab, “VMS Servers”.
Open the view “Port forwarding” and activate the selection “UPnP is in use.”
