Using TruCast

The user can see the cameras that have TruCast capability from the camera toolbar – settings.

For those cameras that have TruCast the setting is available.

For cameras that do not have TruCast, the lower part of the dialogue is disabled.

The setting is memorized for each camera separately.

When TruCast is active, there is a small arrow displayed on top of the camera in the device tree.
