Single Server Behind Router

Scenario 1: Using a system with a single server behind a router/firewall

If the user is accessing a single server from the WAN, he needs to connect to the VMS Server with the outside IP address that the router has translated.
The user can check the port forwarding what the port in use is, but it is highly likely port 5008.
