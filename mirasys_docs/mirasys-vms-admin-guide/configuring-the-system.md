Configuring the System

After connecting the cameras and other devices to the servers, configure the system settings and add user accounts and user profiles.

To configure the system, perform these steps:

Add servers to the system and configure their settings.

Add the correct licenses for the servers. 

Add IP cameras and other IP devices. 

Add user profiles. 

Add user accounts. 

Install the client programs on each computer used to access the system over a network.

A separate “Spotter only” installer is provided.

After configuring the system, back up system settings and all VMS Server settings on the System tab.This way, you can restore the settings, for example, if a hard disk fails.
