Signal Lost Event in Bosch Native Driver

A 'signal lost event' can be enabled in the Bosch native driver when utilizing Bosch encoders.

The setting is adjusted in the System Manager desktop application.

When a user sets this option to 'true,' it will remain so even after VMS updates or driver updates.

This ensures that user preferences for monitoring signal events are maintained consistently without reconfiguring settings post-update.
