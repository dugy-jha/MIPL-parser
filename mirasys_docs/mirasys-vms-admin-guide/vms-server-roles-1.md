VMS Server roles
VMS Server role FAILOVER

To set a server as a failover server, there has to be a free failover license slot available.
 When a server is added as a failover server, the System Manager sets the server to standby mode.
 The Failover VMS Servers group shows server connection states and server general settings if the connection is available.

VMS Server role BROKEN

 The Broken VMS Servers group displays connection states; the settings on broken servers cannot be changed.
 Users can, however, export server logs if there is a connection to a broken server.
 To get a broken server that has been replaced by a failover server back into the system, it must first be removed manually and then added again as a new server.
