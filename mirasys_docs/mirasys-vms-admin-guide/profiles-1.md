Profiles

In Mirasys VMS, Profiles define which VMS components the user has access to and what kind of user rights the user has for the components. The system has one default profile, Service. The default profile contains the devices that the license key of the Main Server specifies.

The devices are grouped by device type. For example, all cameras are in one group and all audio channels are in a different group.

A profile sets a user’s rights in the system. Each user can have 1 to 5 profiles that contain these devices: 

Cameras (fixed cameras and PTZ cameras)

Audio channels

Audio communication channel

Digital inputs (alarm inputs)

Digital outputs (control outputs)

Video outputs

Text channels

Alarms

Plugin instances

Web browser home pages

To see the content of a profile, double-click the profile and the content will load in the main screen.

You can use the default profile as such or edit it freely, for example, group cameras at the exact location or you can add new profiles. A profile can contain devices from different servers.

You can add as many as 2,000 groups and devices to a profile. Furthermore, you can put the devices into groups as you like.
