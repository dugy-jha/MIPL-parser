Supported Cameras

TruCast requires a separate camera capture driver for the client. 

Currently, drivers exist for the following camera manufacturers:

Acti

Axis

Bosch

Dahua

Hikvision

Lilin

Samsung

Sony

Stanley

ONVIF

Use the ONVIF TruCast driver for cameras that are not on the supported list. 

The use of the ONVIF driver requires that the camera is added to the VMS system with the ONVIF driver, not the camera’s native driver.
