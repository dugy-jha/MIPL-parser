Immediate Alarm Export to a specified folder

When system administrators enable and configure this feature, it is possible to directly export an alarm to a specific folder in Alarm Search from the Alarms table in Spotter.

Click the wrench icon under the User and User groups tab in the left-hand side menu to go to Edit user group, then click the wrench next to Mirasys Spotter Enterprise plus to go to the Spotter role Settings tab.

Tick the box for Change alarm export settings under Change settings.
