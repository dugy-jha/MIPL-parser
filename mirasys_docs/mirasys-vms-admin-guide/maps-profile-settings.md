Adding Maps to Profiles

Click the Change Level button and then select the device group to which you want to attach a map.

The devices that belong to the selected group are shown in the left pane.

Subgroups are also shown. You can also double-click the subgroup icons in the left pane to move to a lower level.

Click Add Map and find the image that you want to use as a map.

Zoom to fit above the map is selected by default. You can also unselect Zoom to fit to adjust the zoom with the slider above the map manually.

From the left pane, select the devices and device groups you want to add to the map and click the Add to Map arrow.

Items that are already on the map appear dimmed in the left pane. If you add subgroup icons to the map, the icons will act as links to the subgroup maps.

Users can move to a lower-level map by double-clicking the subgroup icon.

Select the Placemark check box. A placemark (x) and a connecting line are shown on the map. Drag the placemark (x) to the device’s correct position.
