Error "A maximum number of virtual displays in the AVM Display Server was reached."

In some cases you may see error "A maximum number of virtual displays in the AVM Display Server was reached." in Spotter AVM Operator Console plugin.

This error means that you have added too many virtual monitors to Display Server address or there is not enough monitors connected to this Display Server.
