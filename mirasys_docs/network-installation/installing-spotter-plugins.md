Installing Spotter Plugins

Spotter plugins can be added to the system from System Manager.

Spotter plugins are added to System Manager as *.spi files from the system manager first tab – Add-ins – install client plugin.

Each plugin needs to be enabled in the master license. 

If the plugin is not in the license, it can be installed, but will not be deployed to the Spotter. 

After the plugin is installed to System Manager, each Spotter client that login to this Master Server (SMServer) gets the updated plugin the next time the client is started.

The development of custom plugins is possible. 

Contact Mirasys for further information.
