Installing Devices
Installing IP Cameras 

You can connect supported IP cameras and video servers to a server over a TCP/IP network.
An IP camera has a built-in component for capturing video images.
The camera is connected directly to a local area network, and it has its own IP address.
You can also use video servers (encoders) to change analogue cameras into IP cameras.
Video servers are also connected directly to the local area network, and they have their IP addresses.

For a list of supported cameras, see the document Supported IP Cameras that can be accessed from Mirasys Extranet.
Please see the Mirasys VMS Administrator Guide for instructions on installing IP cameras to the system.
