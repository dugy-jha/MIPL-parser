Failover Servers - Optional

Mirasys VMS supports failover video recording servers. 

Failover servers are VMS Servers that are on a passive standby until the system recognizes that one of the active video recording VMS Servers has broken down; at this point, a failover server takes the place of the broken server.

The broken server can be repaired and replaced as a new failover server, while the failover server that took its place can continue operating as an active server.

For details, see the Mirasys VMS Administrator Guide.
