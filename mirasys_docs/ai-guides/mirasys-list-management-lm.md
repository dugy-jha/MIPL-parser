Mirasys List Management Introduction

List Management (LM) is used to process Face Recognition (FR) and License Plate Recognition (LPR) events by matching detected faces and license plates to an identity and identity list. LM service is used to store identities and identity list information, receive and save LPR and FR events, send LPR and FR events to clients, do searches in saved events, and send LPR and FR events to the VMS server for processing.

LM service has the following abilities:

Store identities and identity lists in the database

Receive and store LPR and FR events in the database

Match detected license plates and faces to defined identities and identity lists

Search LPR and FR events from the database using search parameters

Send real-time LPR and FR events for clients and recorders

Send LPR and FR events to the VMS server for processing

Notify clients and recorders about changes in identities and identity lists

Enable integration to License Plate and Face recognition

The list Management service has a separate installer, so it can execute on a separate server or on some VMS server.

List Management settings (identities and identity lists) can be managed in System Manager List Management settings and in the Spotter Smart List Management plugin.
