LPR Country Detection
Country Detection

Country detection is optional, but in some countries, it is recommended to be used: plate number detection accuracy can be improved when the country is known.

Plate number country detection

Plate number detection is available for Eurasia and the Americas.

Country detection is optional. It is useful in countries like Finland, where the letters I and O are the same as numbers 1 and 0. If the country is recognized with high confidence, then country-specific rules can be used to improve plate number detection accuracy.

License plate types

If country detection is enabled, then license plate type can sometimes be detected. License plate type can be undefined or one of these:

antique

diplomatic

export

military

provisional

rental
