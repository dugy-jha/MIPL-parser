VCA Filters - Retrigger Filter

The Retrigger Filter acts as an event pass through, which only generates an event if the input has not fired previously within the defined interval.

Typically, the Retrigger Filter would be applied at the end of a rule(s) combination to prevent duplicate alarms being sent, this provides more granular control than the Event Retrigger Time option. Events produced by the Retrigger Filter will have the event type of the input rule.
