VCA - Basic inputs

A basic input or rule can only be used to trigger an action or as an input to another rule type.
Basic inputs always require a zone, and potentially some additional parameters.
A basic input can be used on its own to trigger an action, although they are often used as an input to other filters or conditional rules.
