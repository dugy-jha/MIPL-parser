VCA - Aggressive Behaviour

A rule which fires when aggressive behaviour is detected in the field of view for longer than the specified duration.

Aggressive behaviour does not require a zone and runs independently of the tracker. Enabling this algorithm, by adding this rule, will impact channel capacity, as the algorithm runs in addition to the channels selected tracker.

Separate VCAbehaviour license needed for this feature.
