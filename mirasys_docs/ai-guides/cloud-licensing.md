Cloud Licensing

Once a valid API Key is provided and the connection to the Cloud Licensing Server is established, the license pool associated with that API key will be shown.

When using Cloud Licensing the license pool available to VCAserver is managed using a cloud portal.

Method: Switches between Cloud Licensing or a License Server.

API Key: An authorization token that links to a Cloud Licensing Account.

Connect: Connects this instance of VCAserver to the Cloud Licensing Servers.

The list of installed licenses and their features are displayed underneath.

On new installations, before a user is able to add sources, the Cloud Licensing account will need a license added to the license pool.
