VCA - Enter and exit

The enter rule detects when objects enter a zone.
In other words, when objects cross from the outside of a zone to the inside of a zone.
Conversely, the exit rule detects when an object leaves a zone: when it crosses the border of a zone from the inside to the outside.

Note: Enter and exit rules differ from appear and disappear rules, as follows:

Whereas the enter rule detects already-tracked objects crossing the zone border from outside to inside, the appear rule detects objects which start being tracked within a zone (e.g. appear in the scene through a door).

Whereas the exit rule detects already-tracked objects crossing the zone border from inside to outside, the disappear rule detects objects which stop being tracked within the zone (e.g. leave the scene through a door).
