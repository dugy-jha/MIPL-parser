Object Recognition Introduction

Object Recognition Search allows operators to search recordings for attributes for both persons and vehicles. The object recognition search searches by the following criteria: where (which cameras), when (time frame), and what (humans or vehicles and their attributes).

For persons, searchable attributes are upper body clothing color (Black, White, Gray, Blue, Green, Red, Yellow), lower body clothing color (Black, Blue, White, Gray, Brown, Green), if they are carrying a bag (generic), and if they are wearing a headwear (generic).

Vehicles can be searched by type (car, motorcycle, van, truck, bicycle, or bus) and by color (Black, Blue, Brown, Gray, Green, Orange, Red, White, and Yellow).
