LPR Alarm triggers and configuration
Alarm triggers

An alarm trigger on the VMS server can be created for each identity list that is configured in List Management settings.

LPR configuration

LPR service can be configured in the System Manager application on the LPR settings tab in the Camera Settings window.

The LPR settings contain information about camera video streams processed by the service. Each stream setting is related to the camera and stream on the recorder. Each LPR service can have its own set of limits.
