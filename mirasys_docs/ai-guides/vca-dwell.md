VCA - Dwell

A dwell rule triggers when an object has remained in a zone for a specified amount of time.
The interval parameter is the time the object has to remain in the zone before an event is triggered.
The following image illustrates how the person detected in the zone is highlighted red as they have dwelt in the zone for the desired period of time.
The two vehicles have not been present in the zone for long enough yet to trigger the dwell rule.
