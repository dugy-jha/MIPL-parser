VCA Zones

Zones are the detection areas on which VCAcore operate.
To detect a specific behaviour, a zone must be configured to specify the area where a rule applies.

Zone specific settings 

The zone configuration menu contains a range of zone-specific configuration parameters:

Type: The type of the zone. Can be one of:

Detection: A zone that detects tracked objects and to which rules can be applied.

Non-detection: A zone that specifies an area that should be excluded from VCAcore analysis.

Objects are not detected in non-detection zones.

Useful for excluding areas of potential nuisance alarms from a scene (e.g. waving trees, flashing lights, etc).

Shape: The shape of the zone. Can be one of:

Polygon: A polygonal detection area with at least three nodes. Rules apply to the whole area.

Line: A single- or multi-segment line with at least two nodes. Rules apply to the length of the line.
