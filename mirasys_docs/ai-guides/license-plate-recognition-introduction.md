License Plate Recognition Introduction

License Plate Recognition (LPR) is used to identify a car using its license plate. It is used in the VMS System to get events when license plates are detected from selected video streams and to detect when specific cars are seen in the video. Together with the Mirasys List Management, this allows you to, for example, create an automatic detection system of cars' access to the parking hall.

The LPR service receives video streams, processes images, detects license plates, and sends notifications with detection data to List Management (LM) service for identity and list matching.

License Plate Recognition service has a separate installer, so it can execute on a separate server or on some VMS server.

On licensing side there is need to add RTSP Streaming Server feature to Management Server and all those servers where is plan to use SmartLPR feature. On Management Server side there is need to be add wanted amount of channels of SmartLPR feature.
