Considering a scene with a Presence rule associated with a zone and a Continuously rule attached to that Presence rule, when the Per Target property is on, the rule will generate an event for each tracked object that is continuously present in the zone. When it is off, only one event will be generated by the rule, even if there are multiple tracked objects within the zone. Additionally, when Per Target is off, the rule will only generate events when there is change of state, i.e. the rule condition changes from true to false or vice versa. When Per Target is off, the state will change when:

Any number of objects enter the zone in question and remain in the zone

All objects leave the zone in question
