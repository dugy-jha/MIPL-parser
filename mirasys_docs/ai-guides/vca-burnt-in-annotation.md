VCA Burnt-in Annotation

Burnt-in Annotations allow VCAserver metadata to be overlaid on to the raw video stream.

The burnt-in annotation settings control which VCAserver metadata (objects, events, etc) is rendered into the video stream.


Note:

To display object parameters such as speed, height, area and classifications, the channel must first be calibrated.

To display DL Classification annotations, the channel must have an active Deep Learning Filter rule configured or the DL People Tracker enabled.

To display colour signature annotations, the channel must have an active Colour Filter rule configured.

Some annotations only apply to certain trackers, in such cases the required tracker is listed in brackets.
