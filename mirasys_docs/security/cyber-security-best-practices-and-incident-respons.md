Cyber Security, Best Practices, and Incident Response
Introduction

Security continues to increase in importance when we see increasing attempts to compromise critical IT infrastructure at corporations.

This guide describes Mirasys' security, physical security measures, and best practices that can help secure your Mirasys VMS against cyber-attacks. This includes security considerations for the hardware and software of a video surveillance system's servers, clients, and network device components.

The guide adopts standard security and privacy controls. It maps them to each of the recommendations, which makes it a resource for compliance across industry, government security, and network security requirements.

The guide provides two different levels of information:

Basic information with general insights into security in the company and the product (VMS systems)

The advanced information in the form of IT-specific technical guidance on hardening Mirasys VMS products.
