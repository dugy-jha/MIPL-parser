Spotter Digital Zoom

In the camera view, it is possible to digitally zoom a selected rectangle of it or zoom in on it. The selected rectangle can open as its view.

Area zoom (shift key + mouse left button)

Pressing the shift key and the mouse left button, a sizeable rectangle appears in the mouse position. Keeping the mouse’s left button down can change the rectangle area size. If the shift key is pressed when releasing the left mouse button, the rectangle area is zoomed to view size. Zoomed view returns to normal side either clicking the mouse right button or selecting the Reset button from View drop-down button.

Pressing the mouse’s right button down over a view, a zoom cross appears over the view. The zoomed area can be changed by moving the mouse when the mouse right button is pressed. Mouse scroll can then be used for zooming in and out when the mouse button is pressed. The current zoomed view stays in view when releasing the mouse’s right button.
