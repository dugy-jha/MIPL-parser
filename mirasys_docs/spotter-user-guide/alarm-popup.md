Alarm popup

The alarm popup plugin can be used to alert a user when a new alarm is activated. The popup window can be a new tab or placed in a camera grid cell. The popup can be opened from the Alarms menu or the device tree.

When the alarm popup tab is open, any new alarm components are automatically opened to it, and they remain there for as long as the alarm is active.The popup is by default highlighted with yellow colour when an alarm is triggered.

Alarm popup settings define how the Alarm popup view opens and closes. The default setting is that the Alarm popup is not opened and closed automatically if it is not open. 

Alarm popup settings can be configured from Spotter > Settings > Alarms > Alarm popup.

Please see the documentation under the Spotter Guide > Alarm Management > Alarm popup
