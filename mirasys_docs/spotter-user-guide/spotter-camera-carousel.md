Running Camera Carousel in a Quad

Here’s how you can run the Camera Carousel in a quad layout:

Open a new, empty tab.

Locate the Camera Carousel plugin in the available plugins list.

Drag and drop the plugin into the first empty camera cell on your new tab.

To create a quad view, repeat the drag-and-drop action three more times. Place the Camera Carousel plugin in the remaining empty cells of the tab.

Once the plugins are placed in each of the four cells, you can configure the cameras displayed in each Carousel.
