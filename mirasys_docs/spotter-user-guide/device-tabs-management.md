Device Tabs Management

Only streams of cameras that are on the open tab are sent to the Spotter.Cameras on the "hidden" tabs are not using network bandwidth to the Spotter but will resume instantly when the tab is activated.Tabs can be reordered by dragging them to a different position.They can also be dragged outside the Spotter window to move the content to a new, automatically created window.If the Ctrl key is pressed when dragging, a copy is made instead of moving.
