Installing Spotter

A Spotter is installed with other applications when the standard VMS installer is used.

If a user wants to install only the Spotter client, he can use the dedicated Spotter-only installer.

A spotter is also available as a standalone executable file (SpotterPlayer.exe), which does not require installation.

This version of Spotter can be used to review video clips, Storyboard clips and video archives.
