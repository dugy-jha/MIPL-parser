Introduction

Mirasys Spotter is a modern, easy-to-use application for viewing live and recorded video and exporting video clips.

Mirasys Spotter can be used to create multi-monitor configurations with multiple independently operating device tabs and windows.

A spotter can also be used to connect to multiple different VMS Servers simultaneously.
Spotter supports camera tours, alarms, audio, I/O feeds, text channels, the opening of video archives and clips, as well as layouts for storing and accessing desired configurations.

A spotter is expandable with various plug-ins like Mirasys Video Wall (MVW) video matrix option (add-on).
This feature's availability depends on the VMS type you have purchased (Base, Pro or Enterprise).
