Monitor Manager

The Monitor Manager plugin is designed for controlling monitors attached to the local PC. It is mainly designed to use when the attached monitors are out of sight.

Enable Monitor Manager Plugin

To enable the monitor manager, you need to enable the AVM API in the Spotter settings.

Go to Spotter > File > Settings > Advanced > Enable External AVM API

You will have to be logged in as an administrator to enable this.

Monitor Manager Device Grid

The user can control the Monitor Manager from the device grid while seeing the cameras in the same Spotter Window. Several Spotter windows and monitors are not necessary.

To use Monitor Manager in the device grid, open the Monitor Manager Plugin inside the device grid.







Time slider: Control Monitor Manager from Operator Console

The time slider can be used for time search at the Monitor Manager operator console. When the user releases the time slider green balloon, the operator console sends a time to search to the Display Server.
