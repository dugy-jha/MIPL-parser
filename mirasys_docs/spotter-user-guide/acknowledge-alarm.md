Acknowledge alarm

It is also possible to acknowledge alarms. For active alarms, there is an "Acknowledge alarm" button.The button is visible for all alarms during their duration. It is also possible to set this option active in the System Manager application's Alarm settings. In that case, the alarm is active until the user acknowledges it.The maximum amount of alarms in the alarm window is 100.If the limit is exceeded, then the oldest inactive alarm is removed.Underneath the alarm window, there is a pull-down window with options to show all alarms (default) or only active alarms.
