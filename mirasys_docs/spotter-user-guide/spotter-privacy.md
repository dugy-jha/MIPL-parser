Spotter Privacy

If you have been assigned sufficient permissions, you will also access the "Privacy" menu. 
In here, you may be given access to turn on/off the privacy zones (if you have sufficient permissions to do this and the functionality has been enabled for the specific cameras).

Examples of facial blurring- and privacy masks that could be disabled from the privacy menu.
