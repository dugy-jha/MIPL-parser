Duplicate to mixed mode

The Mixed Playback Mode allows users to review playback on specific cameras while monitoring real-time situations in other cameras and doing this while staying in the same Spotter tab.The mode is accessed by pressing the Ctrl key and then selecting cameras currently open on the Spotter screen with a mouse left-click.The selected cameras will then be highlighted with a thick green border.The user can select multiple cameras by keeping the Ctrl key pressed and continuing to select other cameras.The selection is cancelled by clicking somewhere without keeping the Ctrl key pressed. 

When some number of cameras are highlighted like this, they are in mixed playback mode.Other cameras that are not selected are always in real-time.The cameras in mixed playback can now be controlled with the time slider balloon, the playback controls, or a joystick jog-wheel.
