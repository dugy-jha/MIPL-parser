VLC Player plugin

In Spotter > Plugins > VLC Player, VLC’s advanced playback options and streaming capabilities can be viewed within Mirasys VMS. Operators can open and control the player and directly integrate the available HLS streams.

There is a default setting in Spotter> Settings> Plugins tab> VLC Player to make it more convenient to play streams you would like to receive frequently or daily.

Use Layouts if you have several feeds open and want to use several monitors. You can also use save tab with VLC Player.

If you want to display the VLC Player stream in the Profile tree permanently, request that your System Administrator configure this in our System Manager > Profile settings.
