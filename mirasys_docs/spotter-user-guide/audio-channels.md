Audio channels

Audio channels have a little blue note symbol indicating that the channel is open.The channel opens automatically if it is added to the component panel.Audio channels have a similar pull-down control as outputs to control mute, unmute and volume.

All component panel components, inputs, outputs and audios can be closed from the individual component close controls.

The whole component panel can be closed from the component panel close control.When the devices are on the grid cell, they can be closed via the usual way with the top right corner "X" control.
