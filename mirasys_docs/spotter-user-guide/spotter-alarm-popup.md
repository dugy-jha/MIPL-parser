Spotter Alarm Popup

Alarm popup settings define how the Alarm popup view opens and closes. 

The default setting is that the Alarm popup is not opened and closes automatically if it is not open. 

Alarm popup opening and closing

If the user wants the Alarm popup to not open normally and only when an alarm happens, he should select the first checkbox.

If the user wants the Alarm popup closed automatically after the last active alarm ends, he should check the second checkbox.
