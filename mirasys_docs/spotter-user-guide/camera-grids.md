Camera Grids

The default view mode of the work area is automatic. Cameras appear all using the same size in this mode, and the position and size change automatically as more cameras are added. There are also fixed grids available, where some cameras can be more significant than others, and cameras stick to the fixed view mode grid and do not move around like in automatic mode. The fixed grids are available from the tab menu
