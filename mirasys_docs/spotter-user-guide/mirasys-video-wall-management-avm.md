Mirasys Video Wall Management (AVM)
Mirasys Video Wall Management Device Grid

The user can control the AVM from the device grid while seeing the cameras in the same Spotter Window. Several Spotter windows and monitors are not necessary.

To use AVM in the device grid, open the AVM Plugin inside the device grid.

Time search AVM from Operator Console.

The time slider can be used for time search at the AVM operator console. When the user releases the time slider green balloon, the operator console sends a time to search to the Display Server.
