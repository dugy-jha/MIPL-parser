Thumbnail Search

A Thumbnail search gives the user a quick way to inspect camera material visually. It is mainly meant for scenarios where some visual change in the camera view can be noticed, and the user wants quickly to find the time when this change has happened. When the Thumbnail search is started, it fetches thumbnails from stored video and displays them on the results view.
