Spotter Playback panel

With the playback buttons, the user can choose the direction and speed of the playback.
With each mouse click, the speed can be increased (left click) or decreased (right-click).
The speed is indicated with a small number on the button.

Very low speeds 1fps, 0.1x, 1/8x, 1/4x and 1/2x are accessible only with the slider or by clicking with mouse right button on the playback button to reduce the speed.

If the user wants to go to real-time mode, there is a "Go to current time" button.
