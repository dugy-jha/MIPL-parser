Spotter Easy LPR

Easy LPR Spotter plugin can be opened from Plugins:

Easy LPR contains the following functionalities:

Live monitoring from the 1 camera at the same time

The search of the number plates

Lists Management

Digital output controlling based on lists

By default, the Easy LPR functionality is related to LPR camera-generated events. Events are saved into the VMS server database, which is used to search events in Spotter’s EasyLPR plugin.

As an alternative, LPR camera-generated events can be used in the Smart LPR plugin and Smart List Management.
