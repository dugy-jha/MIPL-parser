Alarm Search

In Spotter > Search > Alarm Search, Operators can use the Alarm Search to easily find Alarms. This tab is a separate tab plugin.

Open Alarm Search from the top Menu under Search to search for Alarms.

Alarm start and end time

There are options to set the alarm search start time with Date and Time selections on the right side of the alarm search tab. It is also possible to set the end time.

Alarms to be included in the search

Below the Time Settings, under Alarms, there is an alarm drop-down list. It contains all alarms that are included in the selected profile. The user can search for one alarm or several alarms.

Alarms that should be included in the search can be selected by ticking the box next to the alarm. There is also an option to search for all alarms.

Free text search

The alarms included in the selected profile can also be searched using a free text search.

When typing in the free text field, the alarms matching the free text search are automatically selected in the drop-down. They can be unselected by unticking the Select searched box, and individual alarms can be selected instead by ticking the box next to the Alarm in the drop-down menu. This functionality makes it easier to select a group of Alarms with similar naming.

The free text search can be done several times until you have narrowed down all Alarms that you want to include in the search.

Search backward, forward, or most recent alarms

On the bottom left side of the alarm search tab are buttons to start the search. There is a search backwards and search forward button with a clock icon.The search goes backwards or forwards from the set time. Next to the search backwards and forward buttons, another button searches for the most recent alarms.

Stop or pause the search

When a search runs, the pause button between the search backward and the search forward becomes active, and the user can stop or pause the search.

The last found item becomes the new time after the alarm search time and date searches are changed. This way, the user can repeat the exact search further if necessary.

Alarm results are displayed in a list that shows the alarm name, alarm start time, duration and comment. The user can sort the list by clicking on the title fields.

Display alarm information

Selecting a single alarm shows detailed information of the alarm in a tooltip.

When an alarm is selected, the cameras and other devices mapped to it are displayed in the alarm preview field to the right of the result list.

The playback controls can be used to review results.

Each click will refresh the contents on the right.The tooltip shows the name, start time, end time, duration, priority, trigger, action and alarm description and alarm acknowledgements if these are set to alarm and the comment.

Double-clicking on an alarm occurs in the list, opens up the alarm in the alarm view tab.

Commenting alarms

Comments can be added to alarms in the alarm search view.

Select alarm from the list

Click with the mouse in the comment field below the preview area, and write the comment.

Click Save 

Another way to add a comment is to start writing the comment after selecting the result list's alarm. In this case, the Enter key will save the comment.

The comment is displayed on a single line in the result list and a separate Comment field below the alarm component preview area. This way, it is possible to use the Enter key to enter newline characters.
