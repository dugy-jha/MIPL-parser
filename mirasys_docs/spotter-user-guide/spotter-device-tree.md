Spotter Device Tree

The Device tree title shows the name of the Master Server that Spotter is connected to.
Below is a search field that can be used to filter the tree contents.
Any text entered in the area can be removed with the "X" control or by pressing the Esc-key.
This also clears all profile folder searches.




The Device tree contains five different types of content that can be opened to the work area.

Profile

The currently selected profile, which includes the cameras and other devices, is the first item.
The shape can be changed from the title menu.
Each profile folder can be searched independently using profile folder search. 

Device states

When the device is in another state, for example, no signal, connecting, and connection, there is an icon on top of the device symbol.

Alarms

If a device is used as a trigger or an alarm action in an active alarm, it has a yellow highlight colour.
The colours for active and ended alarms can be adjusted in the Alarm Visualization Settings
Alarms can also be assigned a custom colour that can be specified for each alarm separately.

Device name, thumbnail descriptions, and camera info

The name and description are visible in the device tooltip—unique icons for the System Manager Profile Settings devices.

When an Operator has permission to see the Camera info in Spotter, they will see the information chosen in System Manager in the tooltip, indicating what information it is (VMS Server, IP address, Camera model, AI features used, Resolution, Frame rate settings), and this information will be searchable through the search bar above the device tree in Spotter.
