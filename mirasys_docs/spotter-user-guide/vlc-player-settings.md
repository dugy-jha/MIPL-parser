VLC Player settings

The VLC Player plugin allows operators to view and control advanced playback options and streaming capabilities, including HLS streams, directly within Mirasys VMS. You can set default streams for frequent use and configure auto-play settings. System Administrators can add VLC Player to profiles for permanent use via System Manager.

There is a default setting in Spotter> Settings> Plugins tab> VLC Player to make it more convenient to play streams you would like to receive frequently or daily.

If you want to display the VLC Player stream in the Profile tree permanently, request that your System Administrator configure this in our System Manager > Profile settings.
