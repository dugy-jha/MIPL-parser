Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) provides an additional layer of security for your account by requiring a second verification step in addition to your username and password. This ensures that only authorized users can access the system, protecting sensitive video data and system configurations.

2FA is enabled in System Manager by your System Administrator.
