Grid layout

You can add a maximum of 16 cameras to the camera grid on Spotter Web Mobile. On a grid with three cameras, the view is displayed at the same width as the screen, and then it will be displayed in two columns.

You can maximize a single camera view by clicking the top of the stream (header), where the camera name is located. In the single camera view, an arrow in the top left corner allows you to restore the main grid.

You can select one camera in the grid view to allow the user to control the chosen camera(s) for PTZ and playback control. A border surrounding the view indicates that a camera is selected.
